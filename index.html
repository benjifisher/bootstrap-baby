    <h1>Bootstrap Rocks!</h1>
    <p>Watch this page grow as I use more and more components of Bootstrap!
    I am keeping this file in a git repository, and the plan is to create at
    least one tag for each chapter.</p>
    <p>I caught this morning morning's minion:  kingdom of daylight's
    dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding of the rolling level
    underneath him steady air, and striding high there, how he rung upon the
    rein of a wimpling wing in his ecstasy!  Then off, off, forth on swing,
    as a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend:  the hurl and gliding
    rebuffed the big wind.  My heart in hiding stirred for a bird,&mdash;the
    achieve of; the mastery of the thing!</p>
    <p>Brute beauty and valor and act:  oh, air, pride, plume here Buckle!
    AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion times told lovelier,
    more dangerous, O my chevalier.</p>
    <p>No wonder of it:  sheer plod makes plow down sillion shine, and
    blue-bleak embers, ah my dear, fall, gall themselves and gash
    gold-vermillion.</p>
